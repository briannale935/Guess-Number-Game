A game that prompts the user to guess a number between 1-20. Conditional statements are used to provide the user with hints to guess higher or lower based on the user's entry. There is also a high score feature that updates based on how many attempts it takes the user to guess correctly. The high score will be updated each round and keep the highest score until the user refreshes the browser. 

A green background is shown when the user guesses correctly to improve the user experience!
